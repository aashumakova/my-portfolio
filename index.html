      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      After 12 years in healthcare and leadership I decided to dive in an unfamiliar environment and start helping people by coding well working web applications. I have finished a software engineering botocamp in July 2023. The experience has tought me that I do not need to have an answer for everything, but I can always find a solution through commitment, research, and collaboration. I am comfortable being uncomfortable and enjoy a good challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
      In my free time I enjoy spending time outdoors, going on hikes, taking long walks on the beach, sketching, or curling in a blanket on a swing and reading books.

Event listeners were added to document object model manipulation for stage transitions. Wireframed and planned UI design of application. Utilized Git control during the production of the application with frequent commits until deployment.
